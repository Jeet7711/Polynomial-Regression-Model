# Polynomial-Regression-Model
The polynomial regression model is a type of regression analysis that allows for the exploration of non-linear relationships between variables
Sometimes the trend of the data is not really linear and looks curvy. In case we can use Polynomial regression method.
The general form of a polynomial regression equation with one independent variable is:

Y = β₀ + β₁X + β₂X² + β₃X³ + ... + βₙXⁿ + ɛ

Here, Y represents the dependent variable, X is the independent variable, β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the coefficients associated with each term, ɛ represents the error term, and ⁿ represents the degree of the polynomial.
The polynomial regression model allows for fitting a curve rather than a straight line to the data points. By including higher-degree polynomial terms (e.g., quadratic or cubic terms), the model can capture more intricate patterns in the data. The degree of the polynomial determines the flexibility and complexity of the curve that can be fitted to the data.
The benefits of polynomial regression include its ability to capture non-linear relationships and uncover hidden patterns in the data. It can provide a more accurate representation of complex relationships compared to simple linear regression models. Polynomial regression is widely used in fields such as statistics, economics, social sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
In summary, polynomial regression is a valuable technique for modeling non-linear relationships between variables. By introducing polynomial terms, it enables the fitting of curves to the data, allowing for a more accurate representation of complex relationships.
